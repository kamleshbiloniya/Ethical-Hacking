* **Abstract:**  this  project was about learning, exploring and exploiting various security vulnerability in a program.  Project was mostly based on system vulnerabilities under “old-style” Linux system.

     Contents:
     * **Basic linux command**
     * **ssh login**
     * **Assembly Language**
     * **Buffer overflow attack**
     * **Format string attack** <br />
     
     * **Linux Basics**
         **Read, Write & Execute Permissions**
         Permissions are the basic "rights" to act on a file or directory. The basic rights are read, write and execute.
         * Read - a readable permission allows the contents of the file to be viewed
         * Write - a write permission on a file allows you to modify the contents of that file.
         * Execute - for a file, the executable permission allows to run the file and execute a program.
         * We can view permissions for file for directory by ls –l command.
